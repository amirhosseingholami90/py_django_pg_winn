HOW HEROKU WORKS
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/how-heroku-works


Python deployment flow
(1) When you deploy to Heroku, the dependencies you specify in your requirements.txt 
file are automatically installed before app startup.

(2) If you’re using Django, the collectstatic command also runs automatically during 
the deployment process. This command can be tricky to configure properly. To make 
it easier, add the Django-Heroku Python package, which sets up everything for you.

(3) To automatically perform other tasks (such as any required database migrations) 
before your app is deployed, you can add a release phase command to your app.

Python versions and upgrades
(1) By default, your app continues to use whatever version of Python was used when 
it was first deployed. You can specify a different Python runtime to use in your 
app’s runtime.txt file.

(2) You will be notified in your app’s build output if the app’s Python version is 
no longer up to date.


TIPS:
(1) Add Django-Heroku package. then in settings.py add the following:
    import django_heroku
    # Configure Django App for Heroku.
    django_heroku.settings(locals())

(2) requirements.txt:
        django
        gunicorn
        django-heroku

(3)
